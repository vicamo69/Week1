<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 large bell peppers (any color)</li>
<li>1 lb lean (at least 80%) ground beef</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</Li>
<li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 can (15 oz) Muir Glen&trade;organic tomato sauce</li>
<li>3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (3 oz)</li>
</ul>



<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>Cut thin slice from stem end of each bell pepper to remove top of pepper. Remove seeds and membranes; rinse peppers. If necessary, cut thin slice from bottom of each pepper so they stand up straight. In 4-quart Dutch oven, add enough water to cover peppers. Heat to boiling; add peppers. Cook about 2 minutes; drain.</li>
<li>In 10-inch skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is brown; drain. Stir in rice, salt, garlic and 1 cup of the tomato sauce; cook until hot.</li>
<li>Heat oven to 350&deg;.</li>
<li>Stuff peppers with beef mixture. Stand peppers upright in ungreased 8-inch square glass baking dish. Pour remaining tomato sauce over peppers.</li>
<li>Cover tightly with foil. Bake 10 minutes. Uncover and bake about 15 minutes longer or until peppers are tender. Sprinkle with cheese</li>
</ol>
